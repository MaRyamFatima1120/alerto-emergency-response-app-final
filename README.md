# 🚨 Alerto – Emergency Response App

> 💡 *Built with Heart, Inspired by Loss, Designed to Save Lives*

---

## ✨ Inspiration

During my third year of university, everything changed. I had just returned home from my exams when I found my father on the verge of passing away. He wasn’t sick. There were no warnings. I froze. He looked at me from the door — I will never forget that moment. I lost all sense of what to do. My sister reminded me, “Maryam, give CPR — you know it.” I did. I tried. But he didn’t respond.

We called an ambulance — they didn’t pick up right away. When they finally responded, they couldn’t find the route to our house. We lost crucial time. That moment shattered me. I felt everything had ended.

But when I returned to university, my supervisor gave us a project idea — “Build something that helps in emergencies.” That hit straight to my heart. I knew this was my chance to build something meaningful — something that might save someone else’s parent.

## 📱 What It Does

**Alerto** is a real-time emergency response app that connects people in crisis with nearby rescuers.

- Allows users to request emergency help quickly  
- Shares exact GPS location with the nearest available rescuer  
- Live tracking for both the user and rescuer to reduce delays and confusion  
- Real-time status updates and submission with photo evidence  

---

## 🔧 How We Built It

- Developed core logic and UI in **Flutter**  
- Used **Firebase** for Authentication, Firestore, Storage & Cloud Messaging  
- **Google Maps API** for live map tracking & route calculation  
- Designed a **simple UI** with help from my sister, focused on clarity in stressful situations  
- Chose the name *Alerto* 
- Architecture, decisions, and guidance were supported by my supervisor

## 🧠 Challenges We Faced

- Reliving a traumatic night while designing the solution — emotionally intense  
- Building the core version in 2 months — working long hours with little sleep  
- Ensuring real-time sync of GPS using Firebase Firestore  
- Designing a UI that works smoothly under emergency stress  
- Exceeded Google Maps’ Directions API free limit — reached out and received **sponsorship**: they waived charges, and I only paid $12.47
